/* Note Well
  Functions that use any OpenGL data types have 
  to have the proper include statements preceding them
  to compile without errors. Complete programs have the
  necessary includes, standalone functions do not.
  On MS Windows operating system this usually requires
  at least the following: */

#include <windows.h>
#include <GL\GL.h>


/* additional undefined data structures may be found
in code in appendix3.cpp, cutting and pasting is one 
option. Some structures are defined in the book's text
outside of programs in figures such as GLintPoint on
page 49. This is in the headerfiles subdirectory
Some undefined data structures may have to be fleshed
out by the student. Some may be found in other libraries
such as glut.h or Glu.h
